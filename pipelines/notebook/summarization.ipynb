    "01:30 Sofia: Absolutely. Feature Phoenix is a new analytics dashboard allowing our premium users to track their usage efficiency in real-time. The core user story is complete; the Dev team is now integrating the final data pipeline endpoints. The success metric is 20% adoption in the first month.\n",
    "\n",
    "03:00 Alhaan: Thanks. Ms. Mern, how is the pipeline integration looking? Any roadblocks now that the FastAPI auth is stabilized?\n",
    "\n",
    "04:30 Ms. Mern: The FastAPI portion is solid. We've defined the three necessary endpoints: /api/efficiency/daily, /api/efficiency/weekly, and /api/efficiency/summary. I estimate we need three more full development days to complete robust unit testing and deploy to the Staging environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "06:30 Alhaan: Okay, so we're looking at Staging deployment by the end of Friday, November 28th. David, does that give Marketing enough time to prepare for the launch on Tuesday, December 3rd?\n",
    "\n",
    "08:00 David: Launching on December 3rd requires the final UI/UX screenshots and a confirmed feature name by end of day, November 29th, so we can schedule the email campaign and update the landing page. Our dependency is the final, stable Staging link for screenshot capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "10:00 Alhaan: Understood. Ms. Mern, can we promise a stable, QA-approved Staging link by Saturday morning? We need to lock down those front-end assets.\n",

    "11:00 Ms. Mern: Yes, I can commit to having the Staging environment stable and QA-ready by Friday evening, November 28th. I will notify David personally when it's live.\n",
    "\n",
    "12:00 Sofia: Excellent. My team will start drafting the internal documentation and training material based on the current feature set. Alhaan, do you foresee any major risk in the data model scaling beyond initial rollout?\n",
    "\n",
    "14:00 Alhaan: Low risk for V1. The complexity of the current algorithm is manageable for our projected load. We'll start architectural planning for V2 scaling next quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "15:00 Alhaan: Summary of Action Items: 1. Ms. Mern to provide stable Staging link to David by Nov 28th, 7 PM. 2. David to finalize all launch creative (screenshots, name) by Nov 29th. 3. Sofia to complete internal training docs by Dec 2nd. Launch date remains Dec 3rd.\n",
