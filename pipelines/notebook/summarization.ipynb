    "\n",
    "01:30 Sofia: Absolutely. Feature Phoenix is a new analytics dashboard allowing our premium users to track their usage efficiency in real-time. The core user story is complete; the Dev team is now integrating the final data pipeline endpoints. The success metric is 20% adoption in the first month.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "04:30 Ms. Mern: The FastAPI portion is solid. We've defined the three necessary endpoints: /api/efficiency/daily, /api/efficiency/weekly, and /api/efficiency/summary. I estimate we need three more full development days to complete robust unit testing and deploy to the Staging environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "08:00 David: Launching on December 3rd requires the final UI/UX screenshots and a confirmed feature name by end of day, November 29th, so we can schedule the email campaign and update the landing page. Our dependency is the final, stable Staging link for screenshot capture.\n",

    "\n",
    "14:00 Alhaan: Low risk for V1. The complexity of the current algorithm is manageable for our projected load. We'll start architectural planning for V2 scaling next quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "15:00 Alhaan: Summary of Action Items: 1. Ms. Mern to provide stable Staging link to David by Nov 28th, 7 PM. 2. David to finalize all launch creative (screenshots, name) by Nov 29th. 3. Sofia to complete internal training docs by Dec 2nd. Launch date remains Dec 3rd.\n",
